This code was completed as an educational exercise for myself to learn the RSA encryption method (RSA_Intro file).  
The RSA_Factorization file accompanies the RSA_Intro file by given an elementary example of how the encryption scheme could be broken. 
The code included as part of this project was completed for fun and should not be utilized in any legitimate personal or commercial manner.
